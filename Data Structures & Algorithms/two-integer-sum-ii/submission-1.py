# general idea
# solution must use o(1) space
# sorted , means bi-search could be used
# 1-index might be a hint

# use binary search for each element?
# two pointers from the middle, since the array is sorted
# we add the two elements together, if it's bigger -> move the left (total gets smaller)
# if it's smaller -> move the right (the total gets bigger)

## update, the pointers should start from both ends and not middle
# since the pair might be on either halfs, the starting from middle won't
# work in this case

# algorithm ?
# two pointers
# early return is possible since only one pair exists

# Your solution must use O(1) additional space
# time complexity
# since we only go through the list at most one time O(N)
# where the middle two elements are a pair
# by starting from both ends, we can only increase by moving the left pointer up 
# and can only increase by moving the right pointer down, so no pair is missed 

# space complexity
# restricted to O(1), not storing the list element indefinitely
